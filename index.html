  <h3>"Big brand guitars at small prices!"</h3>
  <p>Welcome to The Guitar Co. Established in 2024, we sell an array of electric and acoustic guitar brands such as Gibson, Martin, Taylor and many more!</p>
  <p>Did you know, we have supplied guitars for bands such as U2, Aslan and the Wolfe Tones to name a few?<br>
    You can trust our quality and  prices. We even offer a 30 day money-back guarantee just for extra piece of mind!</p>
  <p> Take a look at <a href="#" class="StoreLink">our guitars.</a> We believe that each guitar we stock should be played before taking it home, therefore we take reservations through our online <a href="/contact/" class="contact-link">contact form</a></p>
  <p class="about-us"></p> The Guitar Co. was established in 2024 by a group of Musicians who wanted more for the music "scene" in Dublin's Fair City.<br>
     We believe that anyone can learn to play guitar and therefore we ensure through our fair pricing, that our guitars are accessible to anyone, regardless of their experience.<br>
     You will also see on our<a href="/events/" class="events-link"> events page </a>that we host a range of events around Dublin every month for players of all levels.
